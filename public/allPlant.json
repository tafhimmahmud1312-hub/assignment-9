Trees and plants also make our surroundings beautiful and keep the air fresh by absorbing carbon dioxide. Their roots hold the soil firmly and prevent erosion, while their leaves provide shade and shelter to many animals. Without plants, life on Earth would not exist. Therefore, we should take care of them and plant more trees to protect our planet and future generations."
